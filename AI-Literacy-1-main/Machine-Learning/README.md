Break into AI with the free-to-audit [Machine Learning Specialization][MACHINE_LEARNING_SPECIALIZATION_URL].
Master fundamental AI concepts and develop practical machine learning skills in the beginner-friendly, 3-course program
by AI visionary Andrew Ng.

**What you'll learn:**
- **Build ML models with NumPy & scikit-learn**  
  - Build & train supervised models for prediction & binary classification tasks (linear, logistic regression)

- **Build & train a neural network with TensorFlow**  
  - Perform multi-class classification  
  - Build & use decision trees & tree ensemble methods  

- **Apply best practices for ML development**  
  - Use unsupervised learning techniques, including clustering & anomaly detection  

- **Build recommender systems**  
  - Use a collaborative filtering approach  
  - Implement a content-based deep learning method  
  - Build a deep reinforcement learning model  


## ðŸš€ Modules ðŸš€

### Course 1 - [Supervised Machine Learning: Regression and Classification][SUPERVISED_LEARNING_COURSE_URL]

In the first course of the Machine Learning Specialization, you will:

- Build machine learning models in Python using popular machine learning libraries NumPy and scikit-learn.
- Build and train supervised machine learning models for prediction and binary classification tasks, including linear
  regression and logistic regression

### Course 2 - [Advanced Learning Algorithms][ADVANCED_LEARNING_COURSE_URL]

In the second course of the Machine Learning Specialization, you will:

- Build and train a neural network with TensorFlow to perform multi-class classification
- Apply best practices for machine learning development so that your models generalize to data and tasks in the real
  world
- Build and use decision trees and tree ensemble methods, including random forests and boosted trees

### Course 3 - [Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning][UNSUPERVISED_LEARNING_COURSE_URL]

In the third course of the Machine Learning Specialization, you will:

- Use unsupervised learning techniques for unsupervised learning: including clustering and anomaly detection.
- Build recommender systems with a collaborative filtering approach and a content-based deep learning method.
- Build a deep reinforcement learning model.
