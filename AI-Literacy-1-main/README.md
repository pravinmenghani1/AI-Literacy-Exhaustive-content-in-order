# AI/ML Learning Study Plan

A comprehensive step-by-step guide for mastering AI and Machine Learning concepts through structured learning materials.

## Phase 1: Foundation & AI Literacy

### 1. AI Enhanced Presentation Overview
- Start with `AI_Enhanced_Presentation.html`
- Get familiar with basic AI concepts and terminology

### 2. Complete AI Literacy Course
- Navigate to `ai-literacy` folder → `index.html`
- Work through the entire presentation systematically
- Complete all modules in sequence
- Review `capstone_solutions` for practical applications

## Phase 2: Machine Learning Fundamentals

### 3. Supervised Learning Deep Dive
- Go to `Machine-Learning` folder → `Supervised` folder
- Study `machine_learning_presentation.html` thoroughly
- Complete all associated quizzes
- Take notes on key supervised learning algorithms and unsupervised algorithms

### 4. Reinforcement Learning
- In `Machine-Learning` folder → `reinforcement` folder
- Review `deepracer-210926185930.pptx`
- Focus on RL concepts and DeepRacer applications

## Phase 3: Hands-on Practice (Optional Advanced Track)

### 5. Practical Implementation
Work through Jupyter notebooks in this order:
- `1_Supervised_Machine_Learning` folder (.ipynb files)
- `2_Advanced_Learning_Algorithms` folder (.ipynb files)  
- `3_Unsupervised_Machine_Learning` folder (.ipynb files)

Execute code examples and experiment with parameters

## Phase 4: Advanced Topics

### 6. Session 3 - Advanced AI Literacy
- Navigate to `session3` folder
- Study `ai-literacy-presentation.html`
- Connect concepts from earlier phases

### 7. Session 4 - Deep Learning & NLP
Go to `session4` folder and study materials in this strict order:
1. `BERT vs GPT.png` (visual comparison)
2. `LSTM.pdf` (technical deep dive)
3. `session 4 notes.rtf` (comprehensive notes)

## Study Tips

- Allocate 2-3 hours per phase
- Take breaks between sessions
- Create your own summary notes
- Practice coding examples in a separate environment
- Review previous phases before moving forward

## Getting Started

To locate the learning materials, use these commands:
```bash
find ~ -name "ai-literacy" -type d
find ~ -name "*Machine-Learning*" -type d
```
