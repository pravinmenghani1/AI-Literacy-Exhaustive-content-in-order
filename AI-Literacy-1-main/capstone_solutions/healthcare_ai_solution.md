## Project Overview
Design an AI system to help radiologists diagnose diseases from chest X-rays with high accuracy and minimal bias.

## Phase 1: Problem Analysis (25/25 points)

### üìä Data Requirements
- **Dataset Size:** 500,000+ chest X-ray images
- **Data Sources:** 
  - NIH Chest X-ray Dataset (112,120 images)
  - MIMIC-CXR Database (377,110 images)
  - CheXpert Dataset (224,316 images)
- **Labels:** 14 common thoracic diseases (pneumonia, pneumothorax, etc.)
- **Format:** DICOM files converted to PNG/JPEG (512x512 pixels)
- **Annotations:** Radiologist-verified labels with confidence scores
- **Metadata:** Patient age, gender, imaging equipment details

### ü§ñ AI Type Selection: **Deep Learning**
**Justification:**
- Medical images are unstructured 3D data (height √ó width √ó RGB)
- Pattern recognition in pixel-level features requires neural networks
- Traditional ML cannot handle complex visual patterns effectively
- Proven success: Google's AI achieved 94% accuracy vs 65% for human radiologists

```

### üìà Success Metrics
- **Primary:** AUC-ROC > 0.90 for each disease class
- **Sensitivity:** >95% (minimize false negatives - missing diseases)
- **Specificity:** >90% (minimize false positives - unnecessary worry)
- **Speed:** <2 seconds per image analysis
- **Radiologist Agreement:** >85% concordance with expert diagnosis

## Phase 3: Ethics & Bias (25/25 points)

### ‚öñÔ∏è Potential Biases
1. **Demographic Bias:**
   - Training data skewed toward certain populations
   - Age/gender representation imbalances
   - Socioeconomic status affecting image quality

2. **Equipment Bias:**
   - Different X-ray machines produce varying image qualities
   - Hospital-specific imaging protocols
   - Older vs newer equipment capabilities

3. **Geographic Bias:**
   - Disease prevalence varies by region
   - Healthcare access disparities
   - Cultural factors in medical imaging

### üõ°Ô∏è Mitigation Strategies
1. **Diverse Data Collection:**
   - Partner with hospitals across 5 continents
   - Ensure 50/50 gender split, age distribution 0-100
   - Include rural and urban healthcare facilities

2. **Bias Detection:**
   - Regular fairness audits using IBM AI Fairness 360
   - Subgroup analysis for different demographics
   - Performance monitoring across patient groups

3. **Human Oversight:**
   - AI provides probability scores, not final diagnosis
   - Radiologist must review all AI recommendations
   - Continuous feedback loop for model improvement
